    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic</li>
      <li>⅓ cup evaporated milk</li>
      <li>8 leaves lettuce</li>
      <li>4 large hard-boiled eggs, halved lengthwise</li>
      <li>8 black olives, pitted and halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a
        boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20
        minutes. Drain and set aside to cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir
        onion in hot oil until tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Cook chile peppers in boiling
        water until soft, about 5 minutes. Run chiles under cold water until
        cool enough to handle; remove and discard skins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion, chile peppers, cream cheese, queso fresco, vegetable oil,
        salt, garlic, and black pepper to a blender; blend until smooth. Stream
        evaporated milk into blended mixture with the blender on until sauce is
        creamy.
      </li>
    </ol>
